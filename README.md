# The Grid, v2

Now featuring Redux, stateless functional components, and a saner directory structure.

## Purpose

Create a grid-based interface for taking notes / fleshing out ideas.  You can only extend the grid through squares that are adjacent to squares in the existing structure. Ideas / notes are meant to branch out from the initial square.
